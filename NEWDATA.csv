A little disappointed
Tried and True
"Good appliance, but a little on the expensive side."
Excellent waffles-a tip for you
Cooks unevenly
Better than any other
Good if you don't use it everyday
"great idea, horrible execution"
Yummy Soft Ice Cream
Not worth the trouble
Love it!!!
Fun but some design flaws...
Good but [could cost less]
wonderful coffee and looks nice on my counter
"Really 3.5 stars; great taste, exquisite looks, second rate thermos carafe design"
Carafe doesn't keep coffee warm
